    <h2>About Me ðŸ’¬</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a 16-year-old web developer who started with front-end development and quickly became passionate about
        building complete web applications. I successfully completed the STEP Academy front-end course, where I
        developed strong skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular. This program gave me a solid foundation and
        boosted my confidence in creating modern, user-friendly interfaces.
        <br>
        <br>
        After completing the course, I'm now focused on expanding my skills into back-end development to become a
        well-rounded full-stack developer. I'm eager to work on real projects, keep improving my coding abilities, and
        gain hands-on experience in building scalable and efficient web solutions.
        <br>
        <br>
        This is just the beginning!
